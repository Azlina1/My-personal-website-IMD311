    <p align="center">Honestly, I had never had any experience working directly dealing with customers or bosses like such as professional jobs. However, I have an experience working as an online merchant doing online business. I used to sell a viral foods on my social media, in fact, my friends and family also love to support my online bussiness by buying the product from me. From doing this job, I can learn to be more independent and got excited when I can earn my own income using social media.</p>
